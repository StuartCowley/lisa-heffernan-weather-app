# Weather App.
___
## Description.
This was my first frontend project which was bootstrapped with [create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which was tested using React Testing Library (RTL), the tests can be found in the tests folder.
The app renders the 5 day weather forecast for a particular city using data, descriptions and React icons. Given more time I would like to add a feature to enable the user to render additional cities to the app at the same time.

## Download and setup.
This project has the following dependencies: React, [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and additional dev dependencies RTL. To download the project:
* Fork the repository.
* Clone down your fork using ```git clone```.
* Change directory into your cloned folder and run ``` npm install ```.
* To start the app run ```npm start```.

## Using the weather app
You can type a U.K. city into the search box and click search. This will render the weather data for that city by making a call to the [weather API](https://mcr-codes-weather-app.herokuapp.com/) with axios. You can click on any day's 'more details' button to get a more detailed forecast for that particular day. Finally you can toggle between a light and dark mode theme.
